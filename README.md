# Cirque Sample Code

Copyright (c) 2025 Cirque Corp. Restrictions apply. See: www.cirque.com/sw-license

## Overview

This repository contains sample code (c and C++) that demonstrates Cirque's capacitive touch solutions. 
Many of these sample programs are Arduino projects for the Teensy 4.0.

## Installation

This entire repository can be placed directly into your Arduino projects directory. The the contents of the libraries directory go in the Arduino/libraries directory.
As you open each .ino, remember to set the Board and Port to the correct values.

## The Code

The code is arranged into these directories. 

### Circular_Touchpad

This contains the projects that are used with the Glidepoint Development Kit, Red Board - 02-000620-00 Rev A02 or later.

### Gen6_BL_Demo

This contains a project that shows how to use the bootloader to update the firmware in a Gen6 device, Blue Board - 02-000658-00 Rev E01 or later.

### Gen6DevKit

This contains the projects that are used with the GlidePoint Gen-6 Development Kit, Blue Board - 02-000658-00 Rev E01 or later.

### libraries

This contains commonly used code for many of the demos. This directory should be put in the Arduino directory.

### *_oldrev

These contain demo code meant for the older revs of the hardware (that feature Teensy3.2 parts).
