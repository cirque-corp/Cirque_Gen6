# Gen 6 Circle Sensor Dev Kit

Copyright (c) 2023 Cirque Corp. Restrictions apply. See: www.cirque.com/sw-license

(Initial Release)

### Overview

This directory contains a sample program that demonstrates the usage of Cirque's
Gen6 touchpad solutions with a Teensy 4.0 development board acting as the host.

This project is intended to run on the Cirque 02-000620-00 PCB, with a 
Teensy 4.0 on-board.

This project presents how to read and interpret data from the Gen6 touchpads. 
This is presented via Serial Port (Use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE).
You can also change various configuration and print settings by sending commands
via Serial Port. Send 'h' for a full list of commands. 

It also enables the dev kit to act as a USB mouse by reading touch data from
an attached Cirque Gen6 touchpad and sending it to the PC as USB-HID mouse data.

NOTE: The Arduino IDE requires projects to be located in a folder with a name 
that matches that of the .ino file (in this case, Dual_Circle_Pads_USB_Mouse).

NOTE: In the Arduino IDE, you must select Tools > USB Type > "Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick".

### Key Command Options
There is a simple command menu available upon entering the 'h' character into 
the serial monitor.
